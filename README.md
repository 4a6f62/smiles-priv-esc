smiles.sh - Pentest quick-check

What it does:
- Lists unusual top-level directories under /
- Finds executable files outside common system paths that the current user can run
- Lists SUID and SGID binaries
- Lists root-owned files that are writable (heuristic)

Usage:
- From a Linux shell (recommended: run on the target or via a reverse shell):

  chmod +x smiles.sh
  ./smiles.sh            # quick scan
  sudo ./smiles.sh --save  # full scan and save report to /tmp

Notes:
- Run as a normal user first. Running as root will show more files but may reduce the number of interesting privilege-escalation candidates.
- The script is a heuristic; always verify findings manually.
